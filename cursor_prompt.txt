Please create the following application:

Application name: OT Cybersecurity Assistant
Coding language: Python
Agentic framework: PydanticAI
Validation framework: Pydantic
API framework: FastAPI
UI Type: CLI
LLM Model: gpt-4o and Llama3.1:8b via Ollama
Database (if needed): MongoDB
Vector Database (if needed): Chroma

Application description:
This is an agentic application that uses PydanticAI to create a cybersecurity assistant. It can parse vulnerability scans and store the details in a database. It can perform Nmap scans and store the results in that same database, correlating the data for matching assets or creating net-new assets. It can accept PCAP files and store the details in the same database, also matching the data to existing assets or creating net-new assets. It has a chat feature that can be used to chat with the user about the data in the database. The application is CLI based, and has a CLI UI/menu for each of the features. The nmap scanning feature should allow several different types of scans, including:

    - Basic Nmap Scan
    - Nmap Scan with Aggressive Host Discovery
    - Nmap Scan with Aggressive Host Discovery and Service Version Detection
    - Nmap Scan with Aggressive Host Discovery, Service Version Detection, and OS Detection
    - Nmap Scan with Aggressive Host Discovery, Service Version Detection, OS Detection, and Vulnerability Scan
